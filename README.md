# Traffic Simulation with Wireless Sensor Networks
 This project integrates the Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) with SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to create an intelligent traffic management system using wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The system simulates traffic sensors that collect vehicle data, detect emergencies, and adaptively control traffic lights to optimize traffic flow.
